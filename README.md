# Timebox - task management and scheduling

[My Notes](notes.md)


> [!NOTE]
>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

> [!NOTE]
>  If you are not familiar with Markdown then you should review the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) before continuing.

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

    - login
    - entering tasks
    - retrieving tasks
    - sending user messages
    - retrieving user responses
    - API call to Google Calendar
    - Register, login, and logout users.
- **DB/Login** - Store users, tasks, and messages. Register and login users.
